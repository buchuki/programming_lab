* ajaxify creating projects and files
* Deleting projects
* edit a project properties
* Style send and share buttons

* One thing I can think of to streamline this is to automatically go to the create project screen when the user selects a lab, if and only if no projects have been created for that user/lab combination. We could also add something to the create project form to optionally create an empty file and open it for editing.

* instructors need to be able to create projects assigned to all participants.
