* ajaxify creating projects and files

* One thing I can think of to streamline this is to automatically go to the create project screen when the user selects a lab, if and only if no projects have been created for that user/lab combination. We could also add something to the create project form to optionally create an empty file and open it for editing.

* instructors need to be able to create projects assigned to all participants.

* Allow renaming files

* consider using session, rather than GET parameters, to specify class, project, file names. Not sure if this can be used in js.
