* when selecting a project, close existing files
* open files highlighted in lefthand list?
    * need to listen for close events on buffer
* Files in directories in projects
* need an indicator that a new chat has come in from a user
    * probably a "read" flag on message objects
* scrollbars on box and scroll to bottom on load
