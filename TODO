* ajaxify creating projects and files
* confirm delete
* Deleting projects
* edit a project properties
* Style send and share buttons

* Completely New Admin

6. importantly, administration functionalities for class, student,
project/assignment and account management should be available for tutors or
other super users.

7. there should be three types of users, at least: guests, students, tutors and
super users. the account management module should be given the type of a user
at registration time, and the system provide different
functionalities/interface/menu items to different type of users.

* instructors need to be able to create projects assigned to all participants.

* One thing I can think of to streamline this is to automatically go to the create project screen when the user selects a lab, if and only if no projects have been created for that user/lab combination. We could also add something to the create project form to optionally create an empty file and open it for editing.
